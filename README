IR Blue for Google Glass

This is a modification of the Android app for IR Blue written by MarDaSo. Mostly it is a drastic simplification of the app, with most of the bells and whistles removed. The incredibly minimal Glass interface just isn't suited to that level of complexity. I also changed the serial handling code to speed it up and make it more reliable.

For now I've been asked by the original author not to release the source of my changes, a request which I will honor.
